## An analysis of data gathered from Kickstarter to determine factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful. 

The purpose of this analysis is to help client in understanding specific factors to make a crowdfunding campaign success, specifically for a play. Also, what makes one unsuccessful as well as understanding a campaign from start to finish in order to follow in the footsteps of successful campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the data, when filtered down to Parent Category, campaigns that are launched in May have the highest success rate. Whereas, campaigns that are launched in December have have the same chance of succeeding as they do failing. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79758494/111094155-991d5100-8508-11eb-92d1-34447d541e55.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
According to the data, by analyzing the goal amount with percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns, the lower the campaign goal, the higher the percentage of having a successful campaign. Between the$15,000 and $19,000 goal range, there is an equal chance for a campaign to fail and to succeed. From that point, the percentage of successful campaigns decreases, while the percentage of failed campaigns increases at around the same rate. There is an outlier between goals of $35,000 to $44,999, where percentage of successful campaigns increases, followed by a drastic decrease.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges with analyzing this data was the amount of data that was not representative of our clients needs. There was a lot of data to sort through to get data that could be used to help Louis make decisions to have a successful campaign.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- One limitation of the data set is the amount of data available for this analysis' specific needs. Although the dataset as a whole is large, just over 1000 of the data presented fits into the parameters needed to help understand how to make a successful Kickstarter campaign for Louis' play. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- A line graph that would be interesting to see would be comparing the number of successes and failures of the "play" subcategory between countries.
